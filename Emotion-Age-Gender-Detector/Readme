## Age and Gender Estimation
This is a Keras implementation of a CNN for estimating age and gender from a face image [1, 2]. In training, the IMDB-WIKI dataset is used.

[Aug. 21, 2020] Refactored; use tensorflow.keras
[Jun. 30, 2019] Another PyTorch-based project was released
[Nov. 12, 2018] Enable Adam optimizer; seems to be better than momentum SGD
[Sep. 23, 2018] Demo from directory
[Aug. 11, 2018] Add age estimation sub-project here
[Jul. 5, 2018] The UTKFace dataset became available for training.
[Apr. 10, 2018] Evaluation result on the APPA-REAL dataset was added.
